Not a single scratch on the whole thing and still smelled like new.</p> <p>Today we took it in the carwash for the first time, wanting to get away winter-grime, salt and asfalt.</p> <p>Car is now clean, but there are lots of scratches over the right side of the roof and lots of smaller ones around the sides, hood and back.</p> <p>Lady working the gas-station (where I used to work around 2010) was really nice and helpful though. Hope it won’t be a huge thing when her boss gets back to me about it, but I’m thinking I should probably get insurance involved right away, just in case..</p> <p>Also my back and neck is shot, probably from static work and guessing poor posture. It’s been too long since I was regularly physically active. I should fix that.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="life"/><category term="frustration"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[february 1st, carwash scratched up our car and I think I'm getting old..?]]></summary></entry></feed>
