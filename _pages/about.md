A dad in my thirties who has been working in IT since 2019, most of those as a operational security analyst or adjacent.

I want this website to be a place for me to practice sharing thoughts, activities, ramblings, projects, guides, and other stuff I like.

Sharing for myself, but if someone finds any of it not utterly useless, I'll count it as a win!

Things I enjoy (but don't do nearly enough of):
- Reading
- Hiking
- Cooking
- Woodworking

Things I don't enjoy:
- Grouping Harry Potter (Fiction) with The Expanse (Science Fiction)
- Capers

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/books.bib` and Jekyll will render your [books page](/books/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
