A dad in my thirties who has been working in IT since 2019, most of those as a operational security analyst or adjacent.

I want this website to be a place for me to practice sharing thoughts, activities, ramblings, projects, guides, and other stuff I like.

Sharing for myself, but if someone finds any of it not utterly useless, I'll count it as a win!

Things I enjoy (but don't do nearly enough of):

- Reading
- Hiking
- Cooking
- Woodworking

Things I don't enjoy:

- Grouping Harry Potter (Fiction) with The Expanse (Science Fiction)
- Capers
