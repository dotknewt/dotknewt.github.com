description: february 1st, carwash scratched up our car and I think I'm getting old..?

We recently got our first car (december last year), bought used, but *flawsless* condition. Not a single scratch on the whole thing and still smelled like new.

Today we took it in the carwash for the first time, wanting to get away winter-grime, salt and asfalt.

Car is now clean, but there are lots of scratches over the right side of the roof and lots of smaller ones around the sides, hood and back.

Lady working the gas-station (where I used to work around 2010) was really nice and helpful though.  Hope it won't be a huge thing when her boss gets back to me about it, but I'm thinking I should probably get insurance involved right away, just in case..

Also my back and neck is shot, probably from static work and guessing poor posture. It's been too long since I was regularly physically active. I should fix that.
